# Heat-Equation-Solver
The program incorporates Finit Element Methods to solve 2D heat equations using trianglular meshing.

The user must follow these steps to use the program properly:
- Run the program from the Main2D script
- Type 1 for Triangular Meshing (Quadrilaterial is not programed yet)
- Type 1 for 1st degree polynomial type (2nd .... are not programmed)
- Type 1, 3, 4, 7, 12 or 16 for 'Points de Gauss'

The results displayed apart from the figures are L2 and relative errors, respectively.
